Settling on an idea:
We have decided on the self-heating bed, through ventilation. Need to expand more on heating element, could be heating coils or some other material. Box will be below the bed, while ventilation will go under blankets and over foot of bed (clipped on by clamps). The main components will be a ventilation system, heating system and the controller, all of which work together to produce either room temperature air or heated air. We will be using an ATMega328, as it seems to have enough pins to accomodate our entire design. Additionally, we need to find ambient temperature readers such that reads can happen both inside the enclosure as well as outside.
