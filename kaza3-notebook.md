# Week of 9/30:
This week was focused on finishing up our design document. We realized there were some gaps in our design, specifically around the safety aspects of the project, as well as the formulaic areas of our design document. We had not yet gotten to the calculations of our heating element which is the nichrome wire wrapped around stainless steel tubing. Therefore we did not know who wmuch power we weould need in our deployment. So we had to run these calculations and calcualte the power draw as well as the thermal output of our nichrome wire. Once we did these things, we added them into our design document as to show that we had verified our theories of heat transfer, and proceded to refine the document. We also were scouting potential enclosures. 

After working with the ECE supply shop and reviewing the options they offered, we realized that their enclosures might not fully meet our specific requirements due to sizing constraints. The primary issue was that we needed a larger area in the center of the box, along with a taller structure to allow for improved airflow and enhanced thermal transfer. These factors are critical to ensure proper heat dissipation and maintain optimal temperatures for our components. After searching online, we found a more suitable option on Amazon, which better fit our needs in terms of both the size and thermal management capabilities. We believe that this new enclosure is the ideal option, and will be working with Greg from the machine shop starting next week to look into how we can moutn our steel rods to the inside fo the box in a safe and secure manner.

# Week of October 2th:
We were still debating on our parts, but we decided to start modelling our enclosure, we had some difficulty finding an enclosure that worked for our purpose at the machine shop, so we had to seek outside sources. Furhthermore this is when we were still looking for blower units, but we are running into issues since many of the units that we are looking at are either very loud since they are industrial style blowers or do not move enough air flow. We found some high CFM fans that we believe will work, so we will probably be proceeeding with these that way we can move enough air around the enclosure while still retaining the low noise barrier.

Below you can see some of the CAD models that I have mocked up in order for us to get an understanding of our dimensions. We also use this CAD and Ansys to perform flow simulations so we can see how the air is going to be flowing and how the thermial transfer will occur.

# October 10th:
We met together in the ECEB, to work on the PCB design and schematic. We ran into some issues since we were unsure if we wanted to have the Buck Converter on the board or if we wanted to have it as a seperate module. We preferred seperate module since it allows us to have easy troubleshooting and unit testing, and the circuit for the buck converter is fairly complicated, so having to solder all of those SMDs perfeclty would be really difficult. Furthermore our PCB is already pretty complicated because we have alot of control aspects like the ESP and the ATMEGA module on the board. For now we decided to leave it on there but we also have the option to add it externally. 

#October 12th:
Today, we received the fans we ordered and immediately began testing to establish a baseline for their airflow performance. To conduct the test, we powered the fans using a bench PSU in the senior design lab. Our goal was to assess the baseline airflow measurment so we could see if this would move enough air that would make a difference when snaked up the tubing underneath the bed. We decided that if we had two fans that were blowing into a insulated container with smaller volume, we would have enough airflow. Furthermore we looked into the Frequency Generator(FG) pin on the pan, and how we could read this signal. It was very convenient since these are PWM fans that we can control the speed off, and we can also get a live speed reading off the fans using the FG pin, so we can create an accurate feedback loop system.
