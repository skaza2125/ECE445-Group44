Week of October 2th:
We were still debating on our parts, but we decided to start modelling our enclosure, we had some difficulty finding an enclosure that worked for our purpose at the machine shop, so we had to seek outside sources. Furhthermore this is when we were still looking for blower units, but we are running into issues since many of the units that we are looking at are either very loud since they are industrial style blowers or do not move enough air flow. We found some high CFM fans that we believe will work, so we will probably be proceeeding with these that way we can move enough air around the enclosure while still retaining the low noise barrier.

**October 11th:** We met together in the ECEB, to work on the PCB design and schematic. We ran into some issues since we were unsure if we wanted to have the Buck Converter on the board or if we wanted to have it as a seperate module. We preferred seperate module since it allows us to have easy troubleshooting and unit testing, and the circuit for the buck converter is fairly complicated, so having to solder all of those SMDs perfeclty would be really difficult. Furthermore our PCB is already pretty complicated because we have alot of control aspects like the ESP and the ATMEGA module on the board. For now we decided to leave it on there but we also have the option to add it externally.
