**October 11th:** We met together in the ECEB, to work on the PCB design and schematic. We ran into some issues since we were unsure if we wanted to have the Buck Converter on the board or if we wanted to have it as a seperate module. We preferred seperate module since it allows us to have easy troubleshooting and unit testing, and the circuit for the buck converter is fairly complicated, so having to solder all of those SMDs perfeclty would be really difficult. Furthermore our PCB is already pretty complicated because we have alot of control aspects like the ESP and the ATMEGA module on the board. For now we decided to leave it on there but we also have the option to add it externally.
